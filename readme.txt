
  The project is a Python 3 notebook which was made on Google Colab and is best run on Google Colab. You need to have a Google account to use Google Colab. You can tune the parameters and play with the code after opening it on Google Colab. You should start running the  cells in the code from the top to the bottom. To load the CSV file and the module successfully, you should open a folder named 'sunspotSupervised' on your Google Drive and paste all of the project files there. I haven't tried to run this project on any other environment besides Google Colab yet. Contact me with any questions or suggestions.
